Some of the matlab code used for the publication:
Andersson, R., Larsson, L., Holmqvist, K., Stridh, M., & Nyström, M. (2017). One algorithm to rule them all? An evaluation and discussion of ten eye movement event-detection algorithms. Behavior Research Methods, 49(2), 616-637. DOI: 10.3758/s13428-016-0738-9

NOTE: THIS CODE HAS NOT BEEN ORGANIZED AND CLEANED -- PRIORITIZED SHARING NOW INSTEAD OF SHARING PERFECT CODE LATER.

Some values in the scripts may have been interactively changed during the analysis, so it should not be a interpreted as run-once-for-complete-results code.
